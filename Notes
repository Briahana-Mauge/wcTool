CCWC word count tool

SUMMARY
Building a command line tool that works like the word count tool 'man wc'

The wc tool can:
count words: -w flag
count lines: -l flag
count characters: -m flag
count bytes: -c flag
have default count option that suppords words, characters, and bytes without putting a flag

What we need to know how to do?
1) Read a file with our program
2) Distingush file types (.txt, .pdf, etc)
3) How to tell what a "line", "word" or "character" is
4) How to create a terminal command
    a) How to add optional flag to a terminal command
5) What is a byte
6) How to count a byte
7) Separate a file into words

TODO:
1) Create a basic terminal command that prints something to the console/terminal
2) Write a command that takes user input
3) Write a test for the command


WHERE TO FIND THINGS:
https://betterprogramming.pub/create-custom-terminal-commands-or-shortcuts-alias-8cc8b2c3f45b
1) ~/custom_bash_commands.sh to change the custom ccwc commands
2) write "source .custom_bash_commands.sh" in the terminal to reload the file after changing it
